# ONION Cards: Roles, Differences, and Purpose

This document explains the **differences between ONION card types** used in the GARLIC methodology and clarifies **why each card exists**. The goal is to make the participatory logic explicit and prevent role confusion during workshops.

---

## Overview: Why Multiple Card Types?

ONION is not only a *modeling framework* but a **participatory process**.  
Different cards exist because **different kinds of work** happen during participatory modeling:

- Sense-making
- Facilitation
- Translation
- Formalization
- Validation

No single role should perform all of these at once.

> **Key principle:**  
> Participation fails when *process control*, *technical authority*, and *representation* collapse into one role.

## Card Types at a Glance

| Card Type | Primary Owner | Core Function |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **ONION Stage Cards** | All participants | Define *where we are* in the participatory process |
| **Role (Voice) Cards** | Participants | Represent stakeholder perspectives |
| **Scenario Cards** | Participants | Anchor discussion in a shared context |
| **Facilitator Guidance Cards** | Facilitator only | Protect process integrity and inclusion |
| **Technical Expert Guidance Cards** | Technical expert only | Translate meaning ↔ structure without deciding |

## 1. ONION Stage Cards  
*(Process Landmarks)*

### Purpose
ONION Stage Cards define the **shared participatory phase** the group is currently in.

They answer:
- *What kind of work are we doing right now?*
- *What is expected at this stage?*
- *What does “done” look like for this phase?*

### What They Do
- Synchronize participants
- Prevent premature abstraction
- Legitimize returning to earlier stages

### What They Do NOT Do
- They do **not** assign authority
- They do **not** define who speaks
- They do **not** prescribe technical solutions

> ONION Stage Cards are **visible to everyone** and belong to the group.

## 2. Facilitator Guidance Cards  
*(Process Guardians)*

### Purpose
Facilitator Guidance Cards exist to **protect participation**, not to shape content.

They answer:
- *When should the facilitator intervene?*
- *What kinds of intervention are appropriate now?*
- *How do we recover when participation breaks down?*

### Why They Are Needed
Participatory modeling fails quietly when:
- Some voices dominate
- Conflict is prematurely resolved
- Technical language silences non-experts

Facilitator cards make **process power explicit and accountable**.

### What Facilitators Are Allowed to Do
- Manage turn-taking
- Slow down or pause modeling
- Call attention to missing voices
- Ask meta-level questions about process

### What Facilitators Are NOT Allowed to Do
- Propose entities or relationships
- Decide modeling outcomes
- Override participant disagreement

> Facilitator Guidance Cards are **not shared with participants** to avoid steering outcomes.

---

## 3. Technical Expert Guidance Cards  
*(Translators, Not Decision-Makers)*

### Purpose
Technical Expert Guidance Cards define **strict boundaries** for expertise.

They answer:
- *How can experts contribute without dominating?*
- *What kinds of technical input are legitimate at each stage?*

### Why They Are Needed
Without explicit limits, technical experts tend to:
- Translate too early
- Optimize away social meaning
- Implicitly decide what “counts” as data

These cards **discipline expertise** rather than amplifying it.

### What Technical Experts Are Allowed to Do
- Translate narratives into possible abstractions
- Explain consequences of modeling choices
- Surface constraints and trade-offs
- Clarify ambiguity

### What Technical Experts Are NOT Allowed to Do
- Declare a “best” model
- Resolve conflicts between roles
- Remove contested elements
- Re-design after validation

> Technical Expert Cards ensure that *feasibility informs decisions* but does not replace them.

## 4. Key Differences Between Facilitator and Technical Expert Cards

| Dimension | Facilitator | Technical Expert |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Focus | Process | Meaning ↔ Structure |
| Authority | Procedural | Informational |
| Intervention Style | Meta-level | Translational |
| Risk if Unchecked | Silencing voices | Technocratic dominance |
| Decides Model? | No | No |

Both roles **support** participation — neither controls outcomes.

## 5. Why These Distinctions Matter

Separating card types achieves three critical goals:

1. **Prevents role collapse**  
   No single actor controls meaning, structure, and process.

2. **Makes power visible**  
   Authority is scoped, staged, and contestable.

3. **Supports teachability**  
   Students learn *how* participatory modeling works — not just ER syntax.

This aligns directly with:
- ONION’s participatory ethics
- GARLIC’s pedagogical objectives
- Sociotechnical views of data modeling as representation, not truth

---

## Summary

ONION cards are not interchangeable tools.  
They encode **who is allowed to do what, when, and why**.

- **ONION Stage Cards** → guide collective progress  
- **Facilitator Guidance Cards** → protect participation  
- **Technical Expert Guidance Cards** → translate without dominating  

Together, they operationalize participatory modeling as a **structured, power-aware practice**.
